# PendulumProject

Description: 
First project using Python to model non linear and linear pendulum motions. 

Usage:
The initial theta value can be changed. 
This allows users to model the effects of different initial angular displacement on non linear and linear pendulum motions.

Explanation of the differences observed:
As the angular displacement increases, the restoring force from the pendulum also increases following the function of cosine(theta). This makes the pendulum non linear because of this cosine(theta) behaviour. However, if the angular displacement is small which means the vibration is small then it could be modelled by linear behaviour as sin(theta) and cos(theta) ~= theta.
